## Project Description
Our HAT (Hardware Attached on Top) is a compact device that incorporates an ultrasonic proximity sensor and a sound sensor, making it an all-in-one solution for non-contact detection and monitoring. Designed to work seamlessly with STM 32 microcontrollers, the HAT offers both motion and sound sensing capabilities that make it an ideal choice for a wide range of use cases such as process monitoring, home automation, surveillance, and non-contact activation. With an onboard battery, the HAT can operate remotely for extended periods, providing reliable and accurate data capture during load-shedding. The HAT's data capture capabilities are enhanced by its micro-USB data transfer, which allows users to easily power the microcontroller and transfer data between it and a computer. Overall, the HAT is an excellent option for businesses and organizations looking for a cost-effective, reliable, and adaptable solution for non-contact detection and monitoring.
