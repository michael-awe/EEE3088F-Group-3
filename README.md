# EEE3088F Project (Group 3)

This GitHub repository contains the source code and documentation for a sound and proximity light sensing HAT (Hardware Attached on Top) designed for an STM32F05C6T6 Discovery board. The repository contains detailed technical documentation with diagrams, schematics and specifications for the HAT's hardware and software.

## Project Description
Our HAT (Hardware Attached on Top) is a compact device that incorporates light proximity sensor and a sound sensor, making it an all-in-one solution for non-contact detection and monitoring. Designed to work seamlessly with STM 32 microcontrollers, the HAT offers both motion and sound sensing capabilities that make it an ideal choice for a wide range of use cases such as process monitoring, home automation, surveillance, and non-contact activation.  
With an onboard battery, the HAT can operate remotely for extended periods, providing reliable and accurate data capture during load-shedding. The HAT's data capture capabilities are enhanced by its micro-USB data transfer, which allows users to easily power the microcontroller and transfer data between it and a computer. Overall, the HAT is an excellent option for businesses and organizations looking for a cost-effective, reliable, and adaptable solution for non-contact detection and monitoring.
